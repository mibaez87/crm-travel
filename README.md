* This is an app developed for business use, specifically for a travel agency wanting to keep track of flights and deadlines related to their contracts and payments.

* Employees can view today's deadlines and departing/arriving flights for all users on the main dashboard upon login. The client list displays all of the companies current clients. Additionally, the deadlines and flights dashboard provides an overview of not just what's happening today but also what's coming up in the next two weeks or month.

* This app is designed to help keep employees organized and house all time-sensitive information in one place so that if any single employee becomes unavailable, anyone else can quickly gather info to assist.
